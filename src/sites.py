  1. Save a screenshot of the site's homepage (a desktop browser, 1440 x 900) in
     docs/images/work/ as <image>-desktop-640.webp and <image>-desktop-960.webp,
     where <image> is the short name you put on the "image" line.
     Claude can take and size the screenshot for you: send it the link.
  2. Rebuild (python tools/build.py) and push.

  name    the business or group, as they write it
  about   one short line: what kind of business, and where
  link    the full web address, starting with https://
  image   a short name for the screenshot files, lowercase, no spaces
  tag     leave empty "" for a normal client site. For a concept, use
          "Volunteer concept, not the official site" or similar.

The homepage shows the first 4. The Work page shows them all.
